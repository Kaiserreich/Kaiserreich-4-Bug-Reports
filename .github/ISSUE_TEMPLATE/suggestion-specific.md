- Anything that suggests adding new content
- Anything that is focused around changing lore
- Anything that will take a significant amount of time to implement
- Anything that isn't specific and actionable change about existing content, as the template specifies
Please know that this isn't out of any disrespect for the ideas you might have for the mod, and encourage people with a passion to get involved either on the subreddit, the discord or even via joining the team itself. But that being said, suggestions that don't match this template will be closed.
