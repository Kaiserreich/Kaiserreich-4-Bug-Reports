        Path locations may vary due to installation/hardware but for Windows users they can be found through your documents folder - **C\Users\USER\Documents\Paradox Interactive\Hearts of Iron IV\save games**
        **NOTE*:* due to how Github handles files, saves will need to be uploaded as a zipped folder. This can be done by right-clicking and selecting the Send to > Compressed (zipped) folder option and it will create a new folder that can be uploaded to Github.

        **NOTE:** The log files are overwritten every time HOI4 is launched, so make sure to grab the log files before restarting the game.
